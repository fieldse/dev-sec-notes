Different ways of analyzing, categorizing, and theorizing about cyberattacks

### Cyber Kill Chain
- Developed by [Lockheed Martin](Organizations.md#Lockheed%20Martin)
- Breaks attacks into seven steps:
	1. Reconnaissance
	2. Weaponization
	3. Delivery
	4. Exploitation
	5. Installation
	6. Command and Control
	7. Actions on Objectives

### MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge
- matrix of tactics and techniques, not an ordered set of steps
- complementary to Lockheed's cyber kill chain
- Developed by [MITRE](Organizations.md#MITRE), a non-profit organization
	- MITRE also maintains CVE system and CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) project

### Diamond model of intrusion analysis

- defines attacks by four terms in mutual relationship: 
	- Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, Victim
- can reveal similarities in different attacks
