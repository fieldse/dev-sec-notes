Categories of policies:
- Security policies
- training policies
- disposal policies
- disaster recovery policies and planning


## Disposal policies

- Asset disposal - may have specific policies for destroying or disposing of data
- purging - software-based data destruction, completely unrecoverable
- clearing - less secure than purging

### Data Collection Procedures
 - Data acquisition about security incidents
 
# Disaster recovery policies

- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) - identifying organizational risks and determine their potential effects, in a metric-based fashion
- Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) - Â The longest period of time a business can be down
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - How long after a security event it would take to resume normal business operations
- Work Recovery Time (WRT) - how long it takes to get a system back to normal
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - Maximum time an organization can tolerate lost data
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) -  the average time it takes to repair a network device when it breaks
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) -  the average time between failures of a device

## Security frameworks

- SABSA - Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture
- COBIT - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology
	- security framework, dividing IT into four domains: 
		- Plan and Organize
		- Acquire and Implement
		- Deliver and Support
		- Monitor and Evaluate
- NIST SP 800-53 
	- security control framework developed by the US Department of Commerce
	- three categories:
		- techinical, operational, management
	- most likely to be used in government work
- ISO 27000
- ITIL - Information Technology Information Library
	- framework originally created by the British government in the 1980s
	- ITIL-4 is now the de facto standard for IT service management
	- unites business operations with IT
	- important for infosec job interviews

## Incident response planning

- Incident response procedure
	- set of procedure that an investigator follows when examining a computer security incident
- Incident Management Program
	- Program of monitoring and detection of security events on a network, and the execution of proper response to those security events
- Order of events: (this is important!)
	1. Preparation
	2. Identification - recognizing whether an event that occurs should be classified as an incident
	3. Containment - isolating the incident
	4. Eradication
	5. Recovery - data restoration, system repair, and reenabling servers, etc after an incident
	6. Lessons Learned
- Incident response team 
	- CSIRT - Computer Security Incident Response Team
	- Key people that are available to respond to security incidents
	- Incident Response Manager - lead coordinator for management to security team
	- Security analyst
		- Triage analyst - determines severity of individual incidents
		- Forensic analyst - after event, gathers evidence & data about how the intrusion occured
		- Threat researchers - keep up to date on new & outcoming threats, and previous threats
### Communication
- Out of band communication
- Backup communication plans
- Up-to-date contact lists
### Forensic procedures
- Identification
- Collection
- Analysis
- Reporting
- Legal hold
- Timeline
