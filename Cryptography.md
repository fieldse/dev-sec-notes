## Types of cryptography

- Symmetric - equal keys held by both parties, which allow both encrypting and decrypting the information
- Assymmetric - keys are split, with a public key being able to encrypt, and a private key being able to decrypt, or vice versa


### Hashing
#hashing #cryptography 
- non-reversible
- generates a unique hash based on content of information. 
- allows verification that data is intact and hasn't been modified
- hashing algorithms:
	- SHA256

## Cryptographic cyphers
#encryption #cryptography 

### RC4 
- #symmetric encryption cypher
-  *TODO* 

### PGP 
- "Pretty Good Privacy"
-  provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication
- used to sign, encrypt, and decrypt texts, emails, files, directories and disk partition
- increases security of email communication 

### AES 
- #symmetric encryption cypher
-  *TODO* 

### 3DES
