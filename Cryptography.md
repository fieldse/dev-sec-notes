## Types of cryptography

- Symmetric - equal keys held by both parties, which allow both encrypting and decrypting the information
- Assymmetric - keys are split, with a public key being able to encrypt, and a private key being able to decrypt, or vice versa


### Hashing
#hashing #cryptography 
- non-reversible
- generates a unique hash based on content of information. 
- allows verification that data is intact and hasn't been modified
- hashing algorithms:
	- SHA256
